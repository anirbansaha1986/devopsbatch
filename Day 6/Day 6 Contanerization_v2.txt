Containerization
-------------------
1) Why?
1.1) - Optimum use of resources - Compute, Storage, Networking

-- Virtualization - Virtual Machines - VMs - Server Consolidation
--- System Center, VSphere, Virtual Box, HyperV...
--- HW Virtualization

-- Containerization
--- Resource distribution in smaller units
--- Application Virtualization

1.2) OSS - Open Source, Communities, Crowdsourcing
- Angular 2 to Angular 8
- Node JS, npm packages
- Web Pack
- Other Libraries

-- Containers - OSS combination
USer Request => LB Service => Container/s


1.3) Services - Layered Approach
- PL => SL => DAL => Data Source/s
  (4)  (2)    (3)    (DB Cluster)
- Login, REgistration, Auth - 20%
- Catalog, Product, Purchase - 80%

App Isolation, Maximize usage of Limited resources

Packaging Strategy - Containerization
Devlopment Strategy - Microservices
Instance Creation Time - VM Size (50 GB to 120 GB), Container Size - 5 MB - 5 GB

2) How
- rKT Container
- LXC/LXD COntainer

- *Docker Container
-- Ecosystem for Containers
--- Container Image Repository
--- Language for Creating Images
--- Container Runtime environment
--- Free or Paid Repositories
--- Commands for working

Node - System/VM

Application Designer and Developers
- Rearchitect the Application
- Microservice Arch where ever applicable 
- Code changes - .Net Core, Java, Spring Boot


Infra and DEv TEam - combined - Infra DEtails + Code mapping [Configuration of Application]
1) Docker File/s => Docker Image
2) Yaml File/s => Docker Compose deployment or Kubernetes deployment

Operations and Infra Team
- Create Container Execution Environment
-- Docker Runtime
- Image REpository
-- Docker Image REpo - Local Server
- Orchestration env
-- Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesosphere

sudo apt install docker.io

Docker Desktop for Windows
- Hyper-V feature has to be enabled
- Cannot Virtual Box
- Kubernetes
- Docker Tools

Docker Images
- Tagging - Repository - Azure, Local, Docker Hub
- Image ID - GUID

Free Repositories
- Any body can do docker pull
- Cannot to docker push

Paid Repositories/Enterprises
- docker push and pull has to be authenticated

docker pull - update local image repo by downloading image from docker hub
